## Overview
This project is an Epidemic/Pandemic Triangulation System for New York City that would play a critical role in preventing the transmission of infections and diseases. The application identifies areas with disease outbreaks by implementing graph-based contact tracing through geolocation data to accurately triangulate the spread of infections.

## Description
This web-based application supports two user roles: (i) Area Managers and (ii) General Users. Area Managers are responsible for managing and updating the health records and test results of users within their designated area, covering a range of diseases and viral tests. General Users, on the other hand, maintain daily routine logs, including their visited locations and corresponding times, which are crucial for contact tracing if they test positive for an illness.

Upon a positive test result, users are required to enter their quarantine details, such as location, household members, and the duration of their quarantine. Area Managers can then update these test results, triggering actions like extending quarantine periods. The system also maintains a repository of addresses linked to test results, enabling precise triangulation of disease spread down to the building level. This feature helps in identifying areas with high infection intensity and aids in targeted response efforts.

## Features
 1. Login for Users & Area Managers
 2. Signup for Users
 3. Maintain Address Repository of Users for further statistics for managers
 4. Area Managers: Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) **Health Records**
 5. Users: Can manage (CRUD) their daily routines of the places visited
 6. Contact Tracing: Use routines and health records to identify the users that need to be notified of exposure
 7. Statistics for area managers showing the most prevalent dieseases in NYC using information from the tables.
 8. Statistics for area managers showing the diesease distribution in their specific area.

## Interesting pages
 1. After a user logs in, in the Contact Trace page, using the routine that the logged in user has provided, and the routine provided by other users (using routines page), the logged in user would be notified if any of the other users who have had similar routines has been tested positive (using health records page by managers) for a virus. This is interesting because it helps one user to know if they have been exposed to a disease that may spread rapidly.
 2. After an area manager logs into the system, in the My Area Stats page, using the data input from the health records module, the manager can triangulate the "risky" zones in the managing area. This is interesting because by knowing the "risky" zones, the area manager can enforce further quarantine rules, movement restrictions which can help to stop a virus from spreading.
